| Product | Codename | Status | ATLAS | Summary |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Document Verification Service | **Matcha** (抹茶) | ✅ Active | [ATLAS](matcha/ATLAS.md) | Universal, domain-agnostic document verification engine. 4-state task lifecycle, flexible rule configuration, async car check integration, SHA-256 change detection, re-flow support, and AI-first verification routing. Includes [ARCHITECTURE](matcha/ARCHITECTURE.md). |
| AI Document Verification Service | **Wasabi** (わさび) | 📝 Draft | [ATLAS](wasabi/ATLAS.md) | Stateless LLM-based document verification engine. Processes document images against Matcha-owned verification instructions. 4-stage pipeline: quality assessment → type classification → instruction-based verification → report assembly. Operates outside Matcha, returns results to Onigiri for early warnings and downstream Matcha routing. |
| Customer & Product Master Data | **DaVinci** (ダヴィンチ) | 📝 Draft | [ATLAS](davinci/ATLAS.md) | Centralized CRM master data store — the enterprise Golden Record. Consent-based data visibility (PDPA), event-driven sync from Core Banking & Policy Admin, customer data change management, collection contact compliance, **data consolidation engine** (field-level source authority, no-data-loss guarantee, admin override with audit trail, self-check), and **data resolution workflow** (3-tier conflict classification, customer change requests, Sensei/Matcha integration). Includes [ARCHITECTURE](davinci/ARCHITECTURE.md). |
| Branch Operations Orchestration | **Sensei** (先生) | 📝 Draft | [ATLAS](sensei/ATLAS.md) | Centralized branch worklist & task tracker. Aggregates work from internal playbooks, external service requests (Onigiri, Matcha, etc.), and supervisor-created tasks into a unified queue. Playbook-driven task orchestration for branch-native workflows (collection, delinquency), drag-and-drop editor with outcome routing, one-by-one + rapid-fire processing modes, supervisor dashboard with exception management, gamified performance tracking. External services push tasks via events; Sensei tracks execution and reports outcomes back. Contact compliance via DaVinci events. |
